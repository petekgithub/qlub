### Implement a page to show the list of products and products can be filtered based on avaliability, price, rate and user can search based on product title using React.js

#### Additional Points

- Optimize the performance of the app to reduce the rerenders - use pure components

  - Reducing the Number of Rerenders:

    - Memoization: Using techniques like React.memo or useMemo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
    - Callback Memoization: Using useCallback to prevent unnecessary function creations.
    - Pure Components: In class-based components, using React.PureComponent to reduce re-renders by checking for reference equality.

  - Lightening the Render Processes:
    - Virtualization: Hiding components for unseen items, such as large data lists, to avoid rendering unnecessary elements.
    - Lazy Loading: Loading components when needed rather than loading the entire application initially.
    - State and Effect Controls: Carefully managing state and effect usage to prevent unnecessary state changes and interactions.
